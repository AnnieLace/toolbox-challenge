###Phaser
I chose to learn about [Phaser](http://phaser.io) for this challenge, which is a framework for making browser games.
Phaser makes it really easy to create a web game, as it has lots of powerful functionality
for implementing physics, sprites, animations, and game necessities that would be difficult to code up from scratch.
Phaser is [on github](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) and has a very active user community. The latest commit was
very recently, on October 15th. They do currently have about 118 issues logged though, so it's not without its bugs.
I made a [very basic game](http://students.washington.edu/lacea/info343/toolbox-challenge/) for my example,
and you shouldn't have to do anything special in order to run it. It shows several fundamentals for making a game with
Phaser, such as game states and a few simple mechanics (timers, movement, scoring, collisions).
For those interested, it's easy to [get started](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started) with Phaser and make a [simple game](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game)
quickly. There are also plenty of tutorials created by both the [staff](http://phaser.io/learn/official-tutorials)
and [users](http://phaser.io/learn/community-tutorials), as well as some [code examples](http://phaser.io/examples).
There's no real way to search through the tutorials on their site though, so if you have something specific in mind,
I found it easier to search for that outside of their site rather than trying to scroll through pages of recently-added
stuff in the hopes of finding something close to what I was looking for.
